# Fuel50 - Dockerized Flyway Migration
This repository contains a set of tools and configurations to manage PostgreSQL database migrations using Flyway, all powered by Docker.
- Docker Compose configuration for running PostgreSQL and Flyway.
- Scripts for fresh installations and updates.
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for building and pushing Docker images to GitHub Container Registry when migration files are updated

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your machine.

## Usage

### **Fresh Install script**

To start from scratch, including a fresh PostgreSQL database and data:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lenara122/fuel50.git
cd fuel50
./fresh_install.sh
```

E.g if under sql/migrations we have:
```
lena@lena:~/assessment/testing2/fuel50/sql/migrations$ ls
V1__schema_init.sql  V2__data_init.sql  V3__schema_add_col.sql  V4__data_add_col.sql  V5__data_add_col.sql
lena@lena:~/assessment/testing2/fuel50/sql/migrations$ 
```
then Flyway Migration will run all scripts after the db container is up. 

According to current sql migration scripts:
- V1__schema_init.sql      -> creates a table users with id, name columns
- V2__data_init.sql        -> inserts 2 users
- V3__schema_add_col.sql   -> adds 1 new column, called address
- V4__data_add_col.sql     -> updates the address data for existing users
- V5__data_add_col.sql     -> inserts 1 user

To access the db container you can use below command:
```
lena@lena:~/assessment/testing2/fuel50$ docker exec -ti db psql -U postgres
psql (17.4 (Debian 17.4-1.pgdg120+2))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# select * from users;
 id |  username  |  name  |  address  
----+------------+--------+-----------
  1 | username_1 | name_1 | address_1
  2 | username_2 | name_2 | address_2
  3 | username_3 | name_3 | address_3
(3 rows)

postgres=# 

```
### **Update script**

To pull the latest images and update the database schema and data of your existing installation
```bash
# Navigate to the directory where you have already cloned the Fuel repository., e.g cd ~/fuel50
./update
```
E.g if i have already proceeded to a fresh installation and i manually added a user.
then by running ./update.sh my data will persist and i will get any further migration updates that someone may have 
pushed under sql/migrations/ in fuel50 repo.
This happens because Flyway keeps track of the X versions(VX__) that has already been migrated under **flyway_schema_history** table. 
So it will run only the X scripts it does not have run yet.

So if i manually added user 4 and somenone pulled a user 5, when i run the ./update.sh i will get:
```
 id |  username  |  name  |  address  
----+------------+--------+-----------
  1 | username_1 | name_1 | address_1
  2 | username_2 | name_2 | address_2
  3 | username_3 | name_3 | address_3
  4 | username_4 | name_4 | address_4
  5 | username_5 | name_5 | address_5
(7 rows)
```
To check the logs of Flyway you can run:
```
lena@lena:~/assessment/testing2/fuel50$ docker-compose logs flyway;

### **Note**
Ensure your migration scripts are placed in the sql/migrations directory and follow the Flyway naming conventions (VX__schema_{desc}.sql, VX_data_{desc}.sql, etc.).
